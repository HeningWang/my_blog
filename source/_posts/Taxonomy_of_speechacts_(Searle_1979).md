### Author information

John R. Searle is an American philosopher, graduated from Oxford University in the UK, worked for the University California Berkley. His main research interests are the philosophy of language and philosophy of mind.

### Text information

The following literature is chapter II from the monography *Expression and Meaning* (Searle 1979). These essays represent a continuation of a line of research begun in Speech Acts (Searle, 1969).

### main focus

Searle wants to answer in the present essay two central questions: a) how many types of speech acts are there; b) how to define them. He begins his work based on Austin's classification of 5 types (verdictive, expositive, exercitive and commissiv), presuppose a distinction between illocutionary force and its propositional content in a formal way: $F(P)$, and finally shows the syntactical differences.

### 3 most important aspects of 12 criteria

 Searle distinguishes illocution acts from illocution verbs, the latter is language specified, the former is not constrained in one single language like English or German, but large-spread phenomena in the human language. A classification of illocutionary acts is hence not equal to the classification of illocutionary verbs. He suggests 12 criteria, and three most crucial of them are listed below: a) illocutionary points or purpose; b) direction of fit between the worlds and words; c) psychological states

**illocutionary points or purpose**: The illocutionary point corresponds to the essential conditions. Different then illocutionary force, it is one of the most important elements that lead to illocutionary force. From this point of view, the illocutionary points of question and request are the same, since in both scenarios the hearers are obliged to do something. 

**direction of fit**: There are two directions, one is that words fit the worlds, the so-called *word-to-world* direction, symbolized in $\downarrow$; one is that worlds fit the words, the so-called *world-to-word* direction, symbolized with $\uparrow$. (To the notion of the symbols, the words are at the top, and the worlds are at the bottom.) Examples for the former case are assertive, for the latter are commissive and directive. There are some acts allowing the fit from both directions $\updownarrow$ as with declarative or none fit $\emptyset$ as with expressive.

**psychological states**: In all of the speech acts, the speaker brings a certain psychological attitude towards a certain proposition, such like belief, regret, intension or desire, this corresponds to the sincerity conditions. Linguistical evidence are that the speaker cannot deny his psychological state explicitly with performative verbs: *\*I state that p, and I don't believe that.* In a formal way, the psychological states are* expressed with $B(Belief)$, $W(want)$, $I(intend)$ so on.

### illustration of Searle's taxonomy with example *assertive*, *directive* and *expressive*

**Assertive**: $$\downarrow B(p)$$

- the illocutionary point: To commit the speaker (in varying degrees) to something's being the case, to the truth of the expressed proposition.
- the direction of fit: word-to-world, the propositional content shall fit the world
- the psychological state: belief
- example verb classes: *conclude, state, deduce*

**Directive**: $$!\uparrow W(H does A)$$

- the illocutionary point: There are attempts (in varying degrees of desire) by the speaker to get the hearer to do something.
- the direction of fit: world-to-word
- the psychological state: want or desire
- example verb classes: *ask order, deduce*
- problematic aspects: In this point of view, questions are a subclass of directives, which, in most of the languages,differ from each other in the sentence type.

**Expressive**: $$E\emptyset (P)(S/H+property)$$

- the illocutionary point: The speaker expresses his attitude to the by the propositional content p specified property that related to either the speaker or the hearer
- the direction of fit: not world-to-word, nor word-to-world, the truth of propositional contents is presupposed.
- the psychological state: determined by the variable P, P is a psychological state
- example verb classes: *thank, regret, congratulate*
- problematic aspects: In this point of view, questions are a subclass of directives, which, in most of the languages,differ from each other in the sentence type.

### Problems of Searle's taxonomy

1. Seale didn't specify the difference between orders and questions, instead of that, he treated them both as subclasses of directive. But, these two speech acts have different sentence modus in German:

(1)\
a. Koch die Hirsebrei!
b. Kochst du die Hirsebrei?
c. Du kochst die Hirsebrei.

It is hard to treat this three sentence-modus (imperative, interrogative, declarative) only in two speech act classes.

2. Questions are by Searle attempts by S to get H to answer. This is in principle wrong idea since what the speaker expects from his question are not the answer this action itself, by the content of the answer. In a formal way:

(2)\
a. Order(H(p))--by Searle same as question  
b. Question(H(Assertive(p)))
